# **Welcome to my Visual Basic .NET repository**
This repository contains my early projects and exercises in Visual Basic .NET programming language. Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) is an object-oriented, event-driven programming language that was developed by Microsoft. It is a successor to classic Visual Basic language, and is part of the .NET framework.

I learned Visual Basic .NET as my first programming language when I was young, and I was fascinated by its simple yet powerful syntax. Throughout my journey with VB.NET, I have explored various data structures, file handling, and object-oriented programming concepts.

In this repository, you will find some of my favorite projects and exercises that demonstrate my understanding of the language. Each project showcases a different aspect of VB.NET programming and provides a glimpse into my learning journey.

I hope that these projects will serve as inspiration or a reference for others who are also interested in learning Visual Basic .NET. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, I believe that you will find something of value in this repository.

Thank you for visiting!
